When there is a newer version of FusionChart files (say, FusionCharts22) all you'll have to do: 
    Delete exisiting FusionCharts link
    Link FusionCharts to FusionCharts22
    Make the following softlinks
DO NOT MAKE COPIES OF THE FILES IN MULTIPLE DIRECTORIES

The js files referenced by Base2010.php etc are all downloaded into FusionCharts21/js directory.
